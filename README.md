# big-board

I wanted to make this keyboard to gain KiCAD experience and work on a larger project that included more difficult CAD.  
This was the first large-scale PCB I've worked on.  
The routing was very difficult, and it forced me to learn how to use vias correctly lol  

Personally, I don't really need much from a keyboard, so I tried to keep it simple with a minimalist design:
* No RGB
* No OLED Display
* No Rotary Encoders
